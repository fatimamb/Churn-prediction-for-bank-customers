# Churn prediction for bank customers


### Project Description

This project is (Data Scientist Capstone) a part of Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Program.

In this project, I will try to find the bank customers who left the bank (closed their account) and who still continue to be a customer.
and I will try to understand the attributes of the customers and I will see if the age or gender affect to close their account.
My goal for this project is to create a model to help us predict the customers who will close their accounts.

### Data:

I have analyzed data publicly available about Churn Modelling and was downloaded from Kaggle, 
and dataset consists of 10000 rows and 14 columns and you can find more information on the link below:
